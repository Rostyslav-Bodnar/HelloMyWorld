# 🌍 HELLOMYWORLD – RTS Game Prototype  

📌 **HELLOMYWORLD** is an **unfinished real-time strategy (RTS) project** featuring **procedural terrain generation**, **resource management**, and **construction mechanics**.  

This project incorporates **Perlin Noise** for dynamic world generation and provides a structured system for **building placement** and **resource extraction**.

## 🏗️ Construction System  

The **Build Mode** allows players to construct buildings within the game.  

🔹 The **right-side panel** contains three modes:  
✔️ **Game** – Standard gameplay view.  
✔️ **Obtain** – Resource extraction mode.  
✔️ **Build** – Construction mode.  

🔹 In **Build Mode**, a construction panel appears, displaying a **list of available buildings**.  
🔹 After selecting a building, players can see its **size and grid placement requirements**.

## ⛏️ Resource Extraction  

The **Obtain Mode** allows players to gather resources efficiently.  

🔹 The **right-side panel** provides access to resource management tools.  
🔹 Players can **select a zone on the map** and choose specific resources to mine.

## 🌿 Procedural Terrain Generation  

The game world is dynamically generated using **Perlin Noise**.  

🔹 The terrain is randomly generated each session, ensuring a unique experience.  
🔹 After the terrain is created, the system spawns resources such as:  
✔️ **Wood (Capsules)**  
✔️ **Stone (Cubes)**
